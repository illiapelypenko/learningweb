interface SomeType {
  readonly prop: string;
}

function doSomething(obj: SomeType) {
  // We can read from 'obj.prop'.
  console.log(`prop has the value '${obj.prop}'.`);

  // But we can't re-assign it.
  obj.prop = "hello";
// Cannot assign to 'prop' because it is a read-only property.
}

// Using the readonly modifier doesn’t necessarily imply that a value is totally immutable - or in other words, that its internal contents can’t be changed. It just means the property itself can’t be re-written to. like const object

// It’s important to manage expectations of what readonly implies. It’s useful to signal intent during development time for TypeScript on how an object should be used. TypeScript doesn’t factor in whether properties on two types are readonly when checking whether those types are compatible, so readonly properties can also change via aliasing.

interface Person {
  name: string;
  age: number;
}

interface ReadonlyPerson {
  readonly name: string;
  readonly age: number;
}

let writablePerson: Person = {
  name: "Person McPersonface",
  age: 42,
};

// works
let readonlyPerson: ReadonlyPerson = writablePerson;

console.log(readonlyPerson.age); // prints '42'
writablePerson.age++;
console.log(readonlyPerson.age); // prints '43'
